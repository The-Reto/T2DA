Container for anonymized representations of tracks taken through users through digital services, initially web browser histories, developed for an [open data hackday](https://digitallearninglab.ch/project/60).

Initially generated from a Mozilla browser history exported to CSV form with the [Datapackage.py CLI](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-py#cli) then expanded using the http://create.frictionlessdata.io/ tool.
